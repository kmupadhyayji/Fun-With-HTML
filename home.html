			<h2>E-Learning</h2>
				<p>With the shift towards the knowledge society, the change of working conditions and the high-speed evolution of information and communication technologies, peoples' knowledge and skills need continuous up-dating. Learning, based on collaborative working, creativity, multidisciplinary, adaptiveness, intercultural communication and problem solving, has taken on an important role in everyday life. The learning process is becoming pervasive, both for individuals and organisations, in formal education, in the professional context and as part of leisure activities. Learning should be accessible to every citizen, independent of age, education, social status and tailored to his/her individual needs.Keeping this in view, NIELIT has developed e-contents for its various courses such as O/A/B level, BCC/CCC, e-Gov, ESDM, CHM â€˜Oâ€™ level etc. As of now, e-contents for 34 modules have been developed which may be accessed through NIELITâ€™s e-content portal at http://econtent.nielit.gov.in.

			<h2>Placement</h2>
				<p>
				In order to provide an impetus to NIELIT qualifiers, efforts are being made to facilitate and empower these qualifiers by way of a dedicated placement portal. To begin with, the portal shall permit the free registration and submission of details by NIELIT qualifiers so that centralized efforts are made to make available these details to the industry for the purpose of employment. The portal shall also facilitate prospective employers to examine and select resumes on specific need and skill sets. Subsequently, the portal shall be scaled to permit non NIELIT qualifiers also to submit their details along with a reasonable fee towards placement efforts by NIELIT.
